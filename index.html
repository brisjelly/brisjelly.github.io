				<h2>What is Jelly?</h2>
				<p>Jelly was historically a casual meetup anyone can join, mostly remote workers who could do with a bit of socialization at the end of the week.</p>

				<p>The in-person meetups don't happen regularly anymore, but we're still active on Slack, and there's occassionally a meet up or casual drinks that might
				come out of that.</p>

				<h2>When &amp; Where</h2>
				<p>Formally we met at <a href="https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/visit/spaces/edge" rel="noopener">The Edge</a> &mdash; part of the State Library of Queensland in South Brisbane.</p>
				<p>This is still a great place to book a window booth or get a table with river views and hang out or do some work.</p>
